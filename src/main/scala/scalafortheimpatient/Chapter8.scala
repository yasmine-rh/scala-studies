//  1. Extend the following BankAccount class to a CheckingAccount class that charges $1
//  for every deposit and withdrawal.
  class BankAccount(initialBalance: Double) extends CheckingAccount(initialBalance:Double) {
    private var balance = initialBalance
    def deposit(amount: Double) = { balance += amount; balance }
    def withdraw(amount: Double) = { balance -= amount; balance }
  }
  class CheckingAccount(initialBalance:Double){
    private var balance = initialBalance
    def processingFee(balance: Double)= {balance - 1}
    //TODO update to inherit withdraw/deposit.
  }

//  2. Extend the BankAccount class of the preceding exercise into a class SavingsAccount
//  that earns interest every month (when a method earnMonthlyInterest is called)
//  and has three free deposits or withdrawals every month. Reset the transaction
//  count in the earnMonthlyInterest method.
  class SavingsAccount(initialBalance: Double) extends BankAccount(initialBalance: Double) {
  def earnsInterest = ???

}
//  3. Consult your favorite Java or C++ textbook that is sure to have an example
//    of a toy inheritance hierarchy, perhaps involving employees, pets, graphical
//  shapes, or the like. Implement the example in Scala.
//  4. Define an abstract class Item with methods price and description. A SimpleItem is
//  an item whose price and description are specified in the constructor. Take
//  advantage of the fact that a val can override a def. A Bundle is an item that
//    contains other items. Its price is the sum of the prices in the bundle. Also
//  provide a mechanism for adding items to the bundle and a suitable description
//  method.
//  5. Design a class Point whose x and y coordinate values can be provided in a
//    constructor. Provide a subclass LabeledPoint whose constructor takes a label
//  value and x and y coordinates, such as
//    new LabeledPoint("Black Thursday", 1929, 230.07)
//  6. Define an abstract class Shape with an abstract method centerPoint and subclasses
//    Rectangle and Circle. Provide appropriate constructors for the subclasses and
//  override the centerPoint method in each subclass.
//  7. Provide a class Square that extends java.awt.Rectangle and has three constructors:
//    one that constructs a square with a given corner point and width, one that
//    constructs a square with corner (0, 0) and a given width, and one that constructs a square with corner (0, 0) and width 0.
//  8. Compile the Person and SecretAgent classes in Section 8.6, “Overriding Fields,”
//  on page 91 and analyze the class files with javap. How many name fields are
//  there? How many name getter methods are there? What do they get? (Hint:
//    Use the -c and -private options.)
//  9. In the Creature class of Section 8.10, “Construction Order and Early Definitions,”
//  on page 94, replace val range with a def. What happens when you also use a
//  def in the Ant subclass? What happens when you use a val in the subclass?
//    Why?
//    10. The file scala/collection/immutable/Stack.scala contains the definition
//  class Stack[A] protected (protected val elems: List[A])
//  Explain the meanings of the protectedkeywords. (Hint: Review the discussion
//    of private constructors in Chapter 5.)
